You are analyzing an image that appears to be an ASCII art â€” a picture made entirely of characters.

Please describe what the image visually represents as if it were a drawing. Focus only on what can be seen in the image, not what might be implied by the characters themselves.

Your output should answer:
1. What object, character, or scene is depicted?
2. What specific visual components stand out? (e.g., a pair of eyes, curved arms, symbols forming ears or horns)
3. What emotion or action (if any) does the image express?

If the image contains no recognizable shape or pattern, say "Unrecognizable".
